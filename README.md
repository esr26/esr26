## Hey <img src="https://github.com/TheDudeThatCode/TheDudeThatCode/blob/master/Assets/Hi.gif" width="29">, I'm Rajkumar 
I'm a Data Scientist with 1.7+ years of hands-on experience building machine learning models, automating data pipelines, and deploying real-time solutions at scale using Python, SQL, AWS, and GCP.

I am currently working at Neoware Technology Solutions, where I led end-to-end projects for a European electric vehicle company—developing XGBoost and LSTM models for predictive maintenance, and deploying them using FastAPI, Flask, and Docker on cloud platforms like AWS and GCP. I've also optimized BI reporting systems using Redshift, MSSQL, and Apache Airflow, reducing manual work by 90% and accelerating insights delivery.

I hold an MBA in Data Analytics from California State University, Fresno and a Bachelor’s in Electronics & Communication Engineering from Anna University. I enjoy working on projects that combine real-world impact with scalable machine learning systems.

I'm always curious about new tools, open-source models, and emerging tech in GenAI and Agentic AI. Currently diving deeper into recommendation systems and transformer-based architectures.

Outside of work? I'm a total sports buff and a huge Formula 1 fan. 🏎️
Let’s chat about machine learning, data science, sports, or life in general!
