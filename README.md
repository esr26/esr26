## Hey <img src="https://github.com/TheDudeThatCode/TheDudeThatCode/blob/master/Assets/Hi.gif" width="29">, I'm Rajkumar 
Current (2022) graduate from the [California State University, Fresno](https://www.fresnostate.edu/). I'm a Machine Learning Engineer/Data Scientist with over two years of experience working in fast-scaling & high-performance teams.

Currently, I am working as a Business Analyst Intern at Caro Nut Company aiming to build a platform to help the management with business insights to increase the business performance. I have also recently worked as a Data Scientist at Educational and Social Research Organisation and at SPI Private Limited as a Data Analyst Intern. I have a Bachelor of Engineering degree in Electronics & Communication Engineering from the [Anna University](https://www.annauniv.edu/nwsnew).

I'm super enthusiastic about learning new technologies and how these can be best used in my job! I often gravitate towards project making me think out of the box and am always up for any new and exciting opportunities coming my way.

Oh, and also, I'm a sports buff and a HUGE F1 Formula fan. Hit me up if you want to talk sports, machine learning, data science, or anything fun in life! :)

I love connecting with new people
